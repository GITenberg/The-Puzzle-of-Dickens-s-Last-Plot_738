<h2><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Forster</span> tells us that Dickens, in
his later novels, from <i>Bleak House</i> onwards (1853),
&ldquo;assiduously cultivated&rdquo; construction, &ldquo;this
essential of his art.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some critics may think, that
since so many of the best novels in the world &ldquo;have no
outline, or, if they have an outline, it is a demned
outline,&rdquo; elaborate construction is not absolutely
&ldquo;essential.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really essential are character,
&ldquo;atmosphere,&rdquo; humour.</p>
<p>But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain
of restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and
unequalled high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no
longer in what Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of
&ldquo;hab nab at a venture.&rdquo;&nbsp; He constructed
elaborate plots, rich in secrets and surprises.&nbsp; He emulated
the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of Gaboriau, while he
combined with some of the elements of the detective novel, or
<i>roman policier</i>, careful study of character.&nbsp; Except
<i>Great Expectations</i>, none of his later tales rivals in
merit his early picaresque stories of the road, such as
<i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Youth
will be served;&rdquo; no sedulous care could compensate for the
exuberance of &ldquo;the first sprightly runnings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the early books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of
Ralph Nickleby, of Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of
the innumerable attractions.&nbsp; But Dickens was more and more
drawn towards the secret that excites curiosity, and to the game
of hide and seek with the reader who tried to anticipate the
solution of the secret.</p>
<p>In April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American
readings; of that labour achieved under painful conditions of
ominously bad health&mdash;found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson
reported, &ldquo;on the brink of an attack of paralysis of his
left side, and possibly of apoplexy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He therefore
abandoned a new series of Readings.&nbsp; We think of
Scott&rsquo;s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which
<i>Peveril</i>, he said, &ldquo;smacked of the
apoplexy.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Dickens&rsquo;s new story of <i>The
Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, first contemplated in July, 1869, and
altered in character by the emergence of &ldquo;a very curious
and new idea,&rdquo; early in August, does not &ldquo;smack of
the apoplexy.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may think that the mannerisms of
Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and of Miss Twinkleton, the
schoolmistress, are not in the author&rsquo;s best vein of
humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Billickin,&rdquo; on the other hand, the
lodging-house keeper, is &ldquo;in very gracious fooling:&rdquo;
her unlooked-for sallies in skirmishes with Miss Twinkleton are
rich in mirthful surprises.&nbsp; Mr. Grewgious may be
caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and Dickens, always
good at boys, presents a <i>gamin</i>, in Deputy, who is in not
unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of <i>Bleak
House</i>.&nbsp; Opinions may differ as to Edwin and Rosa, but
the more closely one studies Edwin, the better one thinks of that
character.&nbsp; As far as we are allowed to see Helena Landless,
the restraint which she puts on her &ldquo;tigerish blood&rdquo;
is admirable: she is very fresh and original.&nbsp; The villain
is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I think,
is the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of a small cathedral town.&nbsp;
Here there is a lack of softness and delicacy of treatment: on
the other hand, the opium den is studied from the life.</p>
<p>On the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in
his plot, his secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek
with the reader.&nbsp; He threw himself into the sport with zest:
he spoke to his sister-in-law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that
he had not sufficiently concealed his tracks in the latest
numbers.&nbsp; Yet, when he died in June, 1870, leaving three
completed numbers still unpublished, he left his secret as a
puzzle to the curious.&nbsp; Many efforts have been made to
decipher his purpose, especially his intentions as to the
hero.&nbsp; Was Edwin Drood killed, or did he escape?</p>
<p>By a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over
the late Lord Lytton&rsquo;s tale for <i>All The Year Round</i>,
&ldquo;The Disappearance of John Ackland,&rdquo; for the purpose
of mystifying the reader as to whether Ackland was alive or
dead.&nbsp; But he was conspicuously defunct!&nbsp; (<i>All the
Year Round</i>, September-October, 1869.)</p>
<p>The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a
study based on deep knowledge of Dickens, is &ldquo;Watched by
the Dead,&rdquo; by the late ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor
(1887).&nbsp; This book, to which I owe much aid, is now out of
print.&nbsp; In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived &ldquo;the auld
mysterie,&rdquo; in his &ldquo;Clues to Dickens&rsquo;s Edwin
Drood&rdquo; (Chapman &amp; Hall and Heywood, Manchester).&nbsp;
From the solution of Mr. Walters I am obliged to dissent.&nbsp;
Of Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s theory I offer some necessary corrections,
and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr. Proctor
left in a state of tangle.&nbsp; As one read and re-read the
fragment, points very dark seemed, at least, to become suddenly
clear: especially one appeared to understand the meaning
half-revealed and half-concealed by Jasper&rsquo;s babblings
under the influence of opium.&nbsp; He saw in his vision,
&ldquo;<i>that</i>, I never saw <i>that</i> before.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We may be sure that he was to see &ldquo;<i>that</i>&rdquo; in
real life.&nbsp; We must remember that, according to Forster,
&ldquo;such was Dickens&rsquo;s interest in things supernatural
that, but for the strong restraining power of his common sense,
he might have fallen into the follies of
spiritualism.&rdquo;&nbsp; His interest in such matters certainly
peeps out in this novel&mdash;there are two specimens of the
supernormal&mdash;and he may have gone to the limited extent
which my hypothesis requires.&nbsp; If I am right, Dickens went
further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of
&ldquo;The Signalman&rdquo; in <i>Mugby Junction</i>.</p>
<p>With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of
Dickens&rsquo;s last plot.&nbsp; Mr. William Archer has kindly
read the proof sheets and made valuable suggestions, but is
responsible for none of my theories.</p>

STORY</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dramatis Person&aelig;</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the discovery of
Dickens&rsquo;s secret in <i>Edwin Drood</i> it is necessary to
obtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their
relations to each other.</p>
<p>About the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in
Cloisterham, a cathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young
University man, Mr. Bud, who had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a
firm of engineers&mdash;somewhere.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;fast
friends and old college companions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both married
young.&nbsp; Mr. Bud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the
father of one child, a daughter, Rosa Bud.&nbsp; Mr. Drood, whose
wife&rsquo;s maiden name was Jasper, had one son, Edwin
Drood.&nbsp; Mrs. Bud was drowned in a boating accident, when her
daughter, Rosa, was a child.&nbsp; Mr. Drood, already a widower,
and the bereaved Mr. Bud &ldquo;betrothed&rdquo; the two
children, Rosa and Edwin, and then expired, when the orphans were
about seven and eleven years old.&nbsp; The guardian of Rosa was
a lawyer, Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with her
mother.&nbsp; To Grewgious Mr. Bud entrusted his wife&rsquo;s
engagement ring, rubies and diamonds, which Grewgious was to hand
over to Edwin Drood, if, when he attained his majority, he and
Rosa decided to marry.</p>
<p>Grewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while
Edwin&rsquo;s maternal uncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen
when the male parents died), was Edwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;trustee,&rdquo; as well as his uncle and devoted
friend.&nbsp; Rosa&rsquo;s little fortune was an annuity
producing &pound;250 a-year: Edwin succeeded to his
father&rsquo;s share in an engineering firm.</p>
<p>When the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about
to proceed to Egypt, as an engineer.&nbsp; Rosa, at school in
Cloisterham, is about seventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.&nbsp;
He is conductor of the Choir of the Cathedral, a &ldquo;lay
precentor;&rdquo; he is very dark, with thick black whiskers,
and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the habit of
opium smoking.&nbsp; He began very early.&nbsp; He takes this
drug both in his lodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in
a den in East London, kept by a woman nicknamed &ldquo;The
Princess Puffer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This hag, we learn, has been a
determined drunkard,&mdash;&ldquo;I drank
heaven&rsquo;s-hard,&rdquo;&mdash;for sixteen years <i>before</i>
she took to opium.&nbsp; If she has been dealing in opium for ten
years (the exact period is not stated), she has been very
disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John
Jasper&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she
is the mother of John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal
grandmother of Edwin Drood.&nbsp; She detests her client, Jasper,
and plays the spy on his movements, for reasons unexplained.</p>
<p>Jasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> of his nephew, and his own pupil in the
musical art.&nbsp; He makes her aware of his passion, silently,
and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions
private.&nbsp; She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are
on uncomfortable terms: she does not love him, while he perhaps
does love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip
about their betrothal.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bloom is off the
plum&rdquo; of their prearranged loves, he says to his friend,
uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed passion for
Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.&nbsp; Rosa is
aware of this fact; &ldquo;a glaze comes over his eyes,&rdquo;
sometimes, she says, &ldquo;and he seems to wander away into a
frightful sort of dream, in which he threatens most . . .
&rdquo;&nbsp; The man appears to have these frightful dreams even
when he is not under opium.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Opening of the Tale</span></h3>
<p>The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower
of Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the
den of the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the
hag herself.&nbsp; This Cathedral tower, thus early and
emphatically introduced, is to play a great but more or less
mysterious part in the romance: that is certain.&nbsp; Jasper,
waking, makes experiments on the talk of the old woman, the
Lascar and Chinaman in their sleep.&nbsp; He pronounces it
&ldquo;unintelligible,&rdquo; which satisfies him that his own
babble, when under opium, must be unintelligible also.&nbsp; He
is, presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern
coast of India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to
understand the sleepers?&nbsp; He is being watched by the hag,
who hates him.</p>
<p>Jasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the
Dean, a nonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular
Christian in the pink of training, a classical scholar, and a
good honest fellow.&nbsp; Jasper gives Edwin a dinner, and gushes
over &ldquo;his bright boy,&rdquo; a lively lad, full of chaff,
but also full of confiding affection and tenderness of
heart.&nbsp; Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore: Jasper
admits that he loathes his life; and that the church singing
&ldquo;often sounds to me quite devilish,&rdquo;&mdash;and no
wonder.&nbsp; After this dinner, Jasper has a &ldquo;weird
seizure;&rdquo; &ldquo;a strange film comes over Jasper&rsquo;s
eyes,&rdquo; he &ldquo;looks frightfully ill,&rdquo; becomes
rigid, and admits that he &ldquo;has been taking opium for a
pain, an agony that sometimes overcomes me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
&ldquo;agony,&rdquo; we learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin speak
lightly of his love, whom Jasper so furiously desires.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take it as a warning,&rdquo; Jasper says, but Edwin,
puzzled, and full of confiding tenderness, does not
understand.</p>
<p>In the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a
walk and has a tiff with Edwin.&nbsp; Sir Luke Fildes&rsquo;s
illustration shows Edwin as &ldquo;a lad with the bloom of a
lass,&rdquo; with a <i>classic profile</i>; <i>and a gracious
head of long</i>, <i>thick</i>, <i>fair hair</i>, long, though we
learn it has just been cut.&nbsp; He wears a soft slouched hat,
and the pea-coat of the period.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Sapsea and Durdles</span></h3>
<p>Next, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor,
sit at their wine, expecting a third guest.&nbsp; Mr. Sapsea
reads his absurd epitaph for his late wife, who is buried in a
&ldquo;Monument,&rdquo; a vault of some sort in the Cathedral
churchyard.&nbsp; To them enter Durdles, a man never sober, yet
trusted with the key of the crypt, &ldquo;as contractor for rough
repairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the crypt &ldquo;he habitually sleeps
off the fumes of liquor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course no Dean would
entrust keys to this incredibly dissipated, dirty, and insolent
creature, to whom Sapsea gives the key of his vault, for no
reason at all, as the epitaph, of course, is to be engraved on
the outside, by Durdles&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; However, Durdles
insists on getting the key of the vault: he has two other large
keys.&nbsp; Jasper, trifling with them, keeps clinking them
together, so as to know, even in the dark, by the sound, which is
the key that opens Sapsea&rsquo;s vault, in the railed-off burial
ground, beside the cloister arches.&nbsp; He has met Durdles at
Sapsea&rsquo;s for no other purpose than to obtain access at will
to Mrs. Sapsea&rsquo;s monument.&nbsp; Later in the evening
Jasper finds Durdles more or less drunk, and being stoned by a
<i>gamin</i>, &ldquo;Deputy,&rdquo; a retainer of a tramp&rsquo;s
lodging-house.&nbsp; Durdles fees Deputy, in fact, to drive him
home every night after ten.&nbsp; Jasper and Deputy fall into
feud, and Jasper has thus a new, keen, and omnipresent
enemy.&nbsp; As he walks with Durdles that worthy explains (in
reply to a question by Jasper), that, by tapping a wall, even if
over six feet thick, with his hammer, he can detect the nature of
the contents of the vault, &ldquo;solid in hollow, and inside
solid, hollow again.&nbsp; Old &rsquo;un crumbled away in stone
coffin, in vault.&rdquo;&nbsp; He can also discover the presence
of &ldquo;rubbish left in that same six foot space by
Durdles&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, if a foreign body were
introduced into the Sapsea vault, Durdles could detect its
presence by tapping the outside wall.&nbsp; As Jasper&rsquo;s
purpose clearly is to introduce a foreign body&mdash;that of
Edwin who stands between him and Rosa&mdash;into Mrs.
Sapsea&rsquo;s vault, this &ldquo;gift&rdquo; of Durdles is, for
Jasper, an uncomfortable discovery.&nbsp; He goes home, watches
Edwin asleep, and smokes opium.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Landlesses</span></h3>
<p>Two new characters are now introduced, Neville and Helena
Landless, <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> twins, orphans, of Cingalese
extraction, probably Eurasian; very dark, the girl &ldquo;almost
of the gipsy type;&rdquo; both are &ldquo;fierce of
look.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man is to read with Canon Crisparkle
and live with him; the girl goes to the same school as
Rosa.&nbsp; The education of both has been utterly neglected;
instruction has been denied to them.&nbsp; Neville explains the
cause of their fierceness to Crisparkle.&nbsp; In Ceylon they
were bullied by a cruel stepfather and several times ran away:
the girl was the leader, always &ldquo;<i>dressed as a boy</i>,
<i>and showing the daring of a man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edwin
Drood&rsquo;s air of supercilious ownership of Rosa Bud
(indicated as a fault of youth and circumstance, not of heart and
character), irritates Neville Landless, who falls in love with
Rosa at first sight.&nbsp; As Rosa sings, at Crisparkle&rsquo;s,
while Jasper plays the piano, Jasper&rsquo;s fixed stare produces
an hysterical fit in the girl, who is soothed by Helena
Landless.&nbsp; Helena shows her aversion to Jasper, who, as even
Edwin now sees, frightens Rosa.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would be afraid
of him, under similar circumstances, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Miss
Landless?&rdquo; asks Edwin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not under any
circumstances,&rdquo; answers Helena, and Jasper &ldquo;thanks
Miss Landless for this vindication of his character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls go back to their school, where Rosa explains to
Helena her horror of Jasper&rsquo;s silent love-making: &ldquo;I
feel that I am never safe from him . . . a glaze comes over his
eyes and he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream
in which he threatens most,&rdquo; as already quoted.&nbsp;
Helena thus, and she alone, except Rosa, understands Jasper
thoroughly.&nbsp; She becomes Rosa&rsquo;s protectress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Let whomsoever it most concerned look well to
it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Jasper has a new observer and enemy, in addition to the
omnipresent street boy, Deputy, and the detective old hag of the
opium den.</p>
<p>Leaving the Canon&rsquo;s house, Neville and Edwin quarrel
violently over Rosa, in the open air; they are followed by
Jasper, and taken to his house to be reconciled over glasses of
mulled wine.&nbsp; Jasper drugs the wine, and thus provokes a
violent scene; next day he tells Crisparkle that Neville is
&ldquo;murderous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something of the
tiger in his dark blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spreads the story of the
<i>fracas</i> in the town.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Grewgious</span></h3>
<p>Grewgious, Rosa&rsquo;s guardian, now comes down on business;
the girl fails to explain to him the unsatisfactory relations
between her and Edwin: Grewgious is to return to her &ldquo;at
Christmas,&rdquo; if she sends for him, and she does send.&nbsp;
Grewgious, &ldquo;an angular man,&rdquo; all duty and sentiment
(he had loved Rosa&rsquo;s mother), has an interview with
Edwin&rsquo;s trustee, Jasper, for whom he has no enthusiasm, but
whom he does not in any way suspect.&nbsp; They part on good
terms, to meet at Christmas.&nbsp; Crisparkle, with whom Helena
has fallen suddenly in love, arranges with Jasper that Edwin and
Landless shall meet and be reconciled, as both are willing to be,
at a dinner in Jasper&rsquo;s rooms, on Christmas Eve.&nbsp;
Jasper, when Crisparkle proposes this, denotes by his manner
&ldquo;some close internal calculation.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see that
he is reckoning how the dinner suits his plan of campaign, and
&ldquo;<i>close</i> calculation&rdquo; may refer, as in Mr.
Proctor&rsquo;s theory, to the period of the moon: <i>on
Christmas Eve there will be no moonshine at midnight</i>.&nbsp;
Jasper, having worked out this problem, accepts
Crisparkle&rsquo;s proposal, and his assurances about Neville,
and shows Crisparkle a diary in which he has entered his fears
that Edwin&rsquo;s life is in danger from Neville.&nbsp; Edwin
(who is not in Cloisterham at this moment) accepts, by letter,
the invitation to meet Neville at Jasper&rsquo;s on Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Edwin visits Grewgious in his London chambers; is
lectured on his laggard and supercilious behaviour as a lover,
and receives the engagement ring of the late Mrs. Bud,
Rosa&rsquo;s mother, which is very dear to Grewgious&mdash;in the
presence of Bazzard, Grewgious&rsquo;s clerk, a gloomy writer of
an amateur unacted tragedy.&nbsp; Edwin is to return the ring to
Grewgious, if he and Rosa decide not to marry.&nbsp; The ring is
in a case, and Edwin places it &ldquo;in his breast.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We must understand, in the breast-pocket of his coat: no other
interpretation will pass muster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her ring&mdash;will
it come back to me?&rdquo; reflects the mournful Grewgious.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Unaccountable Expedition</span></h3>
<p>Jasper now tells Sapsea, and the Dean, that he is to make
&ldquo;a moonlight expedition with Durdles among the tombs,
vaults, towers, and ruins to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; The impossible
Durdles has the keys necessary for this, &ldquo;surely an
unaccountable expedition,&rdquo; Dickens keeps remarking.&nbsp;
The moon seems to rise on this night at about 7.30 p.m.&nbsp;
Jasper takes a big case-bottle of liquor&mdash;drugged, of course
and goes to the den of Durdles.&nbsp; In the yard of this
inspector of monuments he is bidden to beware of a mound of
quicklime near the yard gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;With a little handy
stirring, quick enough to eat your bones,&rdquo; says
Durdles.&nbsp; There is some considerable distance between this
&ldquo;mound&rdquo; of quicklime and the crypt, of which Durdles
has the key, but the intervening space is quite empty of human
presence, as the citizens are unwilling to meet ghosts.</p>
<p>In the crypt Durdles drinks a good deal of the drugged
liquor.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are to ascend the great
Tower,&rdquo;&mdash;and why they do that is part of the Mystery,
though not an insoluble part.&nbsp; Before they climb, Durdles
tells Jasper that he was drunk and asleep in the crypt, last
Christmas Eve, and was wakened by &ldquo;the ghost of one
terrific shriek, followed by the ghost of the howl of a dog, a
long dismal, woeful howl, such as a dog gives when a
person&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; Durdles has made inquiries and,
as no one else heard the shriek and the howl, he calls these
sounds &ldquo;ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are obviously meant to be understood as supranormal
premonitory sounds; of the nature of second sight, or rather of
second hearing.&nbsp; Forster gives examples of Dickens&rsquo;s
tendency to believe in such premonitions: Dickens had himself a
curious premonitory dream.&nbsp; He considerably overdid the
premonitory business in his otherwise excellent story, <i>The
Signalman</i>, or so it seems to a student of these things.&nbsp;
The shriek and howl heard by Durdles are to be repeated, we see,
in real life, later, on a Christmas Eve.&nbsp; The question
is&mdash;when?&nbsp; More probably <i>not</i> on the Christmas
Eve just imminent, when Edwin is to vanish, but, on the Christmas
Eve following, when Jasper is to be unmasked.</p>
<p>All this while, and later, Jasper examines Durdles very
closely, studying the effects on him of the drugged drink.&nbsp;
When they reach the top of the tower, Jasper closely contemplates
&ldquo;that stillest part of it&rdquo; (the landscape)
&ldquo;which the Cathedral overshadows; but he contemplates
Durdles quite as curiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a motive for the scrutiny in either case.&nbsp;
Jasper examines the part of the precincts in the shadow of the
Cathedral, because he wishes to assure himself that it is lonely
enough for his later undescribed but easily guessed proceedings
in this night of mystery.&nbsp; He will have much to do that
could not brook witnesses, after the drugged Durdles has fallen
sound asleep.&nbsp; We have already been assured that the whole
area over which Jasper is to operate is &ldquo;utterly
deserted,&rdquo; even when it lies in full moonlight, about 8.30
p.m.&nbsp; &ldquo;One might fancy that the tide of life was
stemmed by Mr. Jasper&rsquo;s own gate-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
people of Cloisterham, we hear, would deny that they believe in
ghosts; but they give this part of the precinct a wide berth
(Chapter XII.).&nbsp; If the region is &ldquo;utterly
deserted&rdquo; at nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when it
lies in the ivory moonlight, much more will it be free from human
presence when it lies in shadow, between one and two
o&rsquo;clock after midnight.&nbsp; Jasper, however, from the
tower top closely scrutinizes the area of his future
operations.&nbsp; It is, probably, for this very purpose of
discovering whether the coast be clear or not, that Jasper climbs
the tower.</p>
<p>He watches Durdles for the purpose of finding how the drug
which he has administered works, with a view to future operations
on Edwin.&nbsp; Durdles is now in such a state that &ldquo;he
deems the ground so far below on a level with the tower, and
would as lief walk off the tower into the air as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this is apparently meant to suggest that Jasper, on
Christmas Eve, will repeat his expedition, <i>with Edwin</i>,
whom he will have drugged, and that he will allow Edwin to
&ldquo;walk off the tower into the air.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are
later suggestions to the same effect, as we shall see, but they
are deliberately misleading.&nbsp; There are also strong
suggestions to the very opposite effect: it is broadly indicated
that Jasper is to strangle Edwin with a thick black-silk scarf,
which he has just taken to wearing for the good of his
throat.</p>
<p>The pair return to the crypt, Durdles falls asleep, dreams
that Jasper leaves him, &ldquo;and that something touches him and
something falls from his hand.&nbsp; Then something clinks and
gropes about,&rdquo; and the lines of moonlight shift their
direction, as Durdles finds that they have really done when he
wakens, with Jasper beside him, while the Cathedral clock strikes
two.&nbsp; They have had many hours, not less than five, for
their expedition.&nbsp; The key of the crypt lies beside Durdles
on the ground.&nbsp; They go out, and as Deputy begins
stone-throwing, Jasper half strangles him.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Purpose of the Expedition</span></h3>
<p>Jasper has had ample time to take models in wax of all
Durdles&rsquo;s keys.&nbsp; But he could have done that in a few
minutes, while Durdles slept, if he had wax with him, without
leaving the crypt.&nbsp; He has also had time to convey several
wheelbarrowfuls of quicklime from Durdles&rsquo;s yard to Mrs.
Sapsea&rsquo;s sepulchre, of which monument he probably took the
key from Durdles, and tried its identity by clinking.&nbsp; But
even in a Cathedral town, even after midnight, several successive
expeditions of a lay precentor with a wheelbarrow full of
quicklime would have been apt to attract the comment of some
belated physician, some cleric coming from a sick bed, or some
local roysterers.&nbsp; Therefore it is that Dickens insists on
the &ldquo;utterly deserted&rdquo; character of the area, and
shows us that Jasper has made sure of that essential fact by
observations from the tower top.&nbsp; Still, his was a perilous
expedition, with his wheelbarrow!&nbsp; We should probably learn
later, that Jasper was detected by the wakeful Deputy, who
loathed him.&nbsp; Moreover, next morning Durdles was apt to
notice that some of his quicklime had been removed.&nbsp; As far
as is shown, Durdles noticed nothing of that kind, though he does
observe peculiarities in Jasper&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>The next point in the tale is that Edwin and Rosa meet, and
have sense enough to break off their engagement.&nbsp; But Edwin,
represented as really good-hearted, now begins to repent his past
behaviour, and, though he has a kind of fancy for Miss Landless,
he pretty clearly falls deeper in love with his late
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, and weeps his loss in private: so we are
told.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Christmas Eve</span></h3>
<p>Christmas Eve comes, the day of the dinner of three, Jasper,
Landless, and Edwin.&nbsp; The chapter describing this fateful
day (xiv.) is headed, <i>When shall these Three meet again</i>?
and Mr. Proctor argues that Dickens intends that <i>they
shall</i> meet again.&nbsp; The intention, and the hint, are much
in Dickens&rsquo;s manner.&nbsp; Landless means to start, next
day, very early, on a solitary walking tour, and buys an
exorbitantly heavy stick.&nbsp; We casually hear that Jasper
knows Edwin to possess no jewellery, except a watch and chain and
a scarf-pin.&nbsp; As Edwin moons about, he finds the old opium
hag, come down from London, &ldquo;seeking a needle in a bottle
of hay,&rdquo; she says&mdash;that is, hunting vainly for
Jasper.</p>
<p>Please remark that Jasper has run up to town, on December 23,
and has saturated his system with a debauch of opium on the very
eve of the day when he clearly means to kill Edwin.&nbsp; This
was a most injudicious indulgence, in the circumstances.&nbsp; A
maiden murder needs nerve!&nbsp; We know that
&ldquo;fiddlestrings was weakness to express the state of&rdquo;
Jasper&rsquo;s &ldquo;nerves&rdquo; on the day after the night of
opium with which the story opens.&nbsp; On December 24, Jasper
returned home, the hag at his heels.&nbsp; The old woman, when
met by Edwin, has a curious film over her eyes; &ldquo;he seems
to know her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Great heaven,&rdquo; he thinks,
next moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like Jack that night!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
refers to a kind of fit of Jasper&rsquo;s, after dinner, on the
first evening of the story.&nbsp; Edwin has then seen Jack Jasper
in one of his &ldquo;filmy&rdquo; seizures.&nbsp; The woman prays
Edwin for three shillings and sixpence, to buy opium.&nbsp; He
gives her the money; she asks his Christian name.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Edwin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is &ldquo;Eddy&rdquo; a
sweetheart&rsquo;s form of that?&nbsp; He says that he has no
sweetheart.&nbsp; He is told to be thankful that his name is not
Ned.&nbsp; Now, Jasper alone calls Edwin &ldquo;Ned.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Ned&rsquo; is a threatened name, a dangerous
name,&rdquo; says the hag, who has heard Jasper threaten
&ldquo;Ned&rdquo; in his opium dreams.</p>
<p>Edwin determines to tell this adventure to Jasper, <i>but not
on this night</i>: to-morrow will do.&nbsp; Now, <i>did</i> he
tell the story to Jasper that night, in the presence of Landless,
at dinner?&nbsp; If so, Helena Landless might later learn the
fact from Neville.&nbsp; If she knew it, she would later tell Mr.
Grewgious.</p>
<p>The three men meet and dine.&nbsp; There is a fearful
storm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stones are displaced upon the summit of the
great tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next morning, early, Jasper yells to
Crisparkle, who is looking out of his window in Minor Canon Row,
that Edwin has disappeared.&nbsp; Neville has already set out on
his walking tour.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">After the Disappearance</span></h3>
<p>Men go forth and apprehend Neville, who shows fight with his
heavy stick.&nbsp; We learn that he and Drood left Jasper&rsquo;s
house at midnight, went for ten minutes to look at the river
under the wind, and parted at Crisparkle&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;
Neville now remains under suspicion: Jasper directs the search in
the river, on December 25, 26, and 27.&nbsp; On the evening of
December 27, Grewgious visits Jasper.&nbsp; Now, Grewgious, as we
know, was to be at Cloisterham at Christmas.&nbsp; True, he was
engaged to dine on Christmas Day with Bazzard, his clerk; but,
thoughtful as he was of the moody Bazzard, as Edwin was leaving
Cloisterham he would excuse himself.&nbsp; He would naturally
take a great part in the search for Edwin, above all as Edwin had
in his possession the ring so dear to the lawyer.&nbsp; Edwin had
not shown it to Rosa when they determined to part.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;kept it in his breast,&rdquo; and the ring, we learn, was
&ldquo;<i>gifted with invincible force to hold and
drag</i>,&rdquo; so Dickens warns us.</p>
<p>The ring is obviously to be a <i>pi&egrave;ce de
conviction</i>.&nbsp; But our point, at present, is that we do
not know how Grewgious, to whom this ring was so dear, employed
himself at Cloisterham&mdash;after Edwin&rsquo;s
disappearance&mdash;between December 25 and December 27.&nbsp; On
the evening of the 27th, he came to Jasper, saying, &ldquo;I have
<i>just left Miss Landless</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then slowly and
watchfully told Jasper that Edwin&rsquo;s engagement was broken
off, while the precentor gasped, perspired, tore his hair,
shrieked, and finally subsided into a heap of muddy clothes on
the floor.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mr. Grewgious, calmly observing these
phenomena, warmed his hands at the fire for some time before he
called in Jasper&rsquo;s landlady.</p>
<p>Grewgious now knows by Jasper&rsquo;s behaviour that he
believes himself to have committed a superfluous crime, by
murdering Edwin, who no longer stood between him and Rosa, as
their engagement was already at an end.&nbsp; Whether a Jasper,
in real life, would excite himself so much, is another
question.&nbsp; We do not know, as Mr. Proctor insists, what Mr.
Grewgious had been doing at Cloisterham between Christmas Day and
December 27, the date of his experiment on Jasper&rsquo;s
nerves.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor supposes him to have met the living
Edwin, and obtained information from him, after his escape from a
murderous attack by Jasper.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor insists that this
is the only explanation of Grewgious&rsquo;s conduct, any other
&ldquo;is absolutely impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that case the
experiment of Grewgious was not made to gain information from
Jasper&rsquo;s demeanour, but was the beginning of his
punishment, and was intended by Grewgious to be so.</p>
<p>But Dickens has been careful to suggest, with suspicious
breadth of candour, another explanation of the source of
Grewgious&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; If Edwin has really escaped,
and met Grewgious, Dickens does not want us to be sure of that,
as Mr. Proctor was sure.&nbsp; Dickens deliberately puts his
readers on another trail, though neither Mr. Walters nor Mr.
Proctor struck the scent.&nbsp; As we have noted, Grewgious at
once says to Jasper, &ldquo;<i>I have just come from Miss
Landless</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This tells Jasper nothing, but it
tells a great deal to the watchful reader, who remembers that
Miss Landless, and she only, is aware that Jasper loves, bullies,
and insults Rosa, and that Rosa&rsquo;s life is embittered by
Jasper&rsquo;s silent wooing, and his unspoken threats.&nbsp;
Helena may also know that &ldquo;Ned is a threatened name,&rdquo;
as we have seen, and that the menace comes from Jasper.&nbsp; As
Jasper is now known to be Edwin&rsquo;s rival in love, and as
Edwin has vanished, the murderer, Mr. Grewgious reckons, is
Jasper; and his experiment, with Jasper&rsquo;s consequent shriek
and fit, confirms the hypothesis.&nbsp; Thus Grewgious had
information enough, from Miss Landless, to suggest his
experiment&mdash;Dickens intentionally made that clear (though
not clear enough for Mr. Proctor and Mr. Cuming
Walters)&mdash;while his experiment gives him a moral certainty
of Jasper&rsquo;s crime, but yields no legal evidence.</p>
<p>But does Grewgious know no more than what Helena, and the fit
and shriek of Jasper, have told him?&nbsp; Is his knowledge
limited to the evidence that Jasper has murdered Edwin?&nbsp; Or
does Grewgious know more, know that Edwin, in some way, has
escaped from death?</p>
<p>That is Dickens&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; But whereas Grewgious,
if he believes Jasper to be an actual murderer, should take him
seriously; in point of fact, he speaks of Jasper in so light a
tone, as &ldquo;our local friend,&rdquo; that we feel no
certainty that he is not really aware of Edwin&rsquo;s escape
from a murderous attack by Jasper, and of his continued
existence.</p>
<p>Presently Crisparkle, under some mysterious impression,
apparently telepathic (the book is rich in such psychical
phenomena), visits the weir on the river, at night, and next day
finds Edwin&rsquo;s watch and chain in the timbers; his scarf-pin
in the pool below.&nbsp; The watch and chain must have been
placed purposely where they were found, they could not float
thither, and, if Neville had slain Edwin, he would not have
stolen his property, of course, except as a blind, neutralised by
the placing of the watch in a conspicuous spot.&nbsp; However,
the increased suspicions drive Neville away to read law in Staple
Inn, where Grewgious also dwells, and incessantly watches Neville
out of his window.</p>
<p>About six months later, Helena Landless is to join Neville,
who is watched at intervals by Jasper, who, again, is watched by
Grewgious as the precentor lurks about Staple Inn.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dick Datchery</span></h3>
<p>About the time when Helena leaves Cloisterham for town, a new
character appears in Cloisterham, &ldquo;a white-headed personage
with black eyebrows, <i>buttoned up in a tightish blue
surtout</i>, with a buff waistcoat, grey trowsers, and something
of a military air.&rdquo;&nbsp; His shock of white hair was
unusually thick and ample.&nbsp; This man, &ldquo;a buffer living
idly on his means,&rdquo; named Datchery, is either, as Mr.
Proctor believed, Edwin Drood, or, as Mr. Walters thinks, Helena
Landless.&nbsp; By making Grewgious drop the remark that Bazzard,
his clerk, a moping owl of an amateur tragedian, &ldquo;is off
duty here,&rdquo; at his chambers, Dickens hints that Bazzard is
Datchery.&nbsp; But that is a mere false scent, a ruse of the
author, scattering paper in the wrong place, in this long paper
hunt.</p>
<p>As for Helena, Mr. Walters justly argues that Dickens has
marked her for some important part in the ruin of Jasper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was a slumbering gleam of fire in her intense dark
eyes.&nbsp; Let whomsoever it most concerned look well to
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, we have been told that Helena had high
courage.&nbsp; She had told Jasper that she feared him &ldquo;in
no circumstances whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, we have learned
that in childhood she had dressed as a boy when she ran away from
home; and she had the motives of protecting Rosa and her brother,
Neville, from the machinations of Jasper, who needs watching, as
he is trying to ruin Neville&rsquo;s already dilapidated
character, and, by spying on him, to break down his nerve.&nbsp;
Really, of course, Neville is quite safe.&nbsp; There is no
<i>corpus delicti</i>, no carcase of the missing Edwin Drood.</p>
<p>For the reasons given, Datchery might be Helena in
disguise.</p>
<p>If so, the idea is highly ludicrous, while nothing is proved
either by the blackness of Datchery&rsquo;s eyebrows
(Helena&rsquo;s were black), or by Datchery&rsquo;s habit of
carrying his hat under his arm, not on his head.&nbsp; A person
who goes so far as to wear a conspicuous white wig, would not be
afraid also to dye his eyebrows black, if he were Edwin; while
either Edwin or Helena <i>must</i> have &ldquo;made up&rdquo; the
face, by the use of paint and sham wrinkles.&nbsp; Either Helena
or Edwin would have been detected in real life, of course, but we
allow for the accepted fictitious convention of successful
disguise, and for the necessities of the novelist.&nbsp; A
tightly buttoned surtout would show Helena&rsquo;s feminine
figure; but let that also pass.&nbsp; As to the hat,
Edwin&rsquo;s own hair was long and thick: add a wig, and his hat
would be a burden to him.</p>
<p>What is most unlike the stern, fierce, sententious Helena, is
Datchery&rsquo;s habit of &ldquo;chaffing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He fools
the ass of a Mayor, Sapsea, by most exaggerated diference: his
tone is always that of indolent mockery, which one doubts whether
the &ldquo;intense&rdquo; and concentrated Helena could
assume.&nbsp; He takes rooms in the same house as Jasper, to
whom, as to Durdles and Deputy, he introduces himself on the
night of his arrival at Cloisterham.&nbsp; He afterwards
addresses Deputy, the little <i>gamin</i>, by the name
&ldquo;Winks,&rdquo; which is given to him by the people at the
Tramps&rsquo; lodgings: the name is a secret of
Deputy&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Jasper, Rosa, and Tartar</span></h3>
<p>Meanwhile Jasper formally proposes to Rosa, in the school
garden: standing apart and leaning against a sundial, as the
garden is commanded by many windows.&nbsp; He offers to resign
his hopes of bringing Landless to the gallows (perhaps this bad
man would provide a <i>corpus delicti</i> of his own making!) if
Rosa will accept him: he threatens to &ldquo;pursue her to the
death,&rdquo; if she will not; he frightens her so thoroughly
that she rushes to Grewgious in his chambers in London.&nbsp; She
now suspects Jasper of Edwin&rsquo;s murder, but keeps her
thoughts to herself.&nbsp; She tells Grewgious, who is watching
Neville,&mdash;&ldquo;I have a fancy for keeping him under my
eye,&rdquo;&mdash;that Jasper has made love to her, and Grewgious
replies in a parody of &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo;!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Thee his hopes to fix<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn him again!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would he fool thus, if he knew Jasper to have killed
Edwin?&nbsp; He is not certain whether Rosa should visit Helena
next day, in Landless&rsquo;s rooms, opposite; and Mr. Walters
suggests that he may be aware that Helena, dressed as Datchery,
is really absent at Cloisterham.&nbsp; However, next day, Helena
is in her brother&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; Moreover, it is really a
sufficient explanation of Grewgious&rsquo;s doubt that Jasper is
lurking around, and that not till next day is a <i>private</i>
way of communication arranged between Neville and his
friends.&nbsp; In any case, next day, Helena is in her
brother&rsquo;s rooms, and, by aid of a Mr. Tartar&rsquo;s rooms,
she and Rosa can meet privately.&nbsp; There is a good deal of
conspiring to watch Jasper when he watches Neville, and in this
new friend, Mr. Tartar, a lover is provided for Rosa.&nbsp;
Tartar is a miraculously agile climber over roofs and up walls, a
retired Lieutenant of the navy, and a handy man, being such a
climber, to chase Jasper about the roof of the Cathedral, when
Jasper&rsquo;s day of doom arrives.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Jasper&rsquo;s Opium Visions</span></h3>
<p>In July, Jasper revisits the London opium den, and talks under
opium, watched by the old hag.&nbsp; He speaks of a thing which
he often does in visions: &ldquo;a hazardous and perilous
journey, over abysses where a slip would be destruction.&nbsp;
Look down, look down!&nbsp; You see what lies at the bottom
there?&rdquo;&nbsp; He enacts the vision and says, &ldquo;There
was a fellow traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;speaks in a
whisper, and as if in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vision is, in
this case, &ldquo;a poor vision: no struggle, no consciousness of
peril, no entreaty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edwin, in the reminiscent
vision, dies very easily and rapidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;When it comes
to be real at last, it is so short that it seems unreal for the
first time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet I never saw <i>that</i>
before.&nbsp; Look what a poor miserable mean thing it is.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> must be real.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What can all this mean?&nbsp; We have been told that, shortly
before Christmas Eve, Jasper took to wearing a thick black-silk
handkerchief for his throat.&nbsp; He hung it over his arm,
&ldquo;his face knitted and stern,&rdquo; as he entered his house
for his Christmas Eve dinner.&nbsp; If he strangled Edwin with
the scarf, as we are to suppose, he did not lead him, drugged, to
the tower top, and pitch him off.&nbsp; Is part of Jasper&rsquo;s
vision reminiscent&mdash;the brief, unresisting death&mdash;while
another part is a separate vision, is <i>prospective</i>,
&ldquo;premonitory&rdquo;?&nbsp; Does he see himself pitching
Neville Landless off the tower top, or see him fallen from the
Cathedral roof?&nbsp; Is Neville&rsquo;s body
&ldquo;<i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I never saw <i>that</i>
before.&nbsp; Look what a poor miserable mean thing it is!&nbsp;
<i>That</i> must be real.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper &ldquo;never saw
<i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the dead body below the
height&mdash;before.&nbsp; <i>This</i> vision, I think, is of the
future, not of the past, and is meant to bewilder the reader who
thinks that the whole represents the slaying of Drood.&nbsp; The
tale is rich in &ldquo;warnings&rdquo; and telepathy.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Datchery and the Opium Woman</span></h3>
<p>The hag now tracks Jasper home to Cloisterham.&nbsp; Here she
meets Datchery, whom she asks how she can see Jasper?&nbsp; If
Datchery is Drood, he now learns, <i>what he did not know
before</i>, <i>that there is some connection between Jasper and
the hag</i>.&nbsp; He walks with her to the place where Edwin met
the hag, on Christmas Eve, and gave her money; and he jingles his
own money as he walks.&nbsp; The place, or the sound of the
money, makes the woman tell Datchery about Edwin&rsquo;s gift of
three shillings and sixpence for opium.&nbsp; Datchery,
&ldquo;with a sudden change of countenance, gives her a sudden
look.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not follow that he is <i>not</i>
Drood, for, though the hag&rsquo;s love of opium was known to
Drood, Datchery is not to reveal his recognition of the
woman.&nbsp; He does what any stranger would do; he &ldquo;gives
a sudden look,&rdquo; as if surprised by the mention of
opium.</p>
<p>Mr. Walters says, &ldquo;Drood would not have changed
countenance on hearing a fact he had known six months
previously.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if Drood was playing at being
somebody else, he would, of course, give a kind of start and
stare, on hearing of the opium.&nbsp; When he also hears from the
hag that her former benefactor&rsquo;s name was Edwin, he asks
her how she knew that&mdash;&ldquo;a fatuously unnecessary
question,&rdquo; says Mr. Walters.&nbsp; A needless question for
Datchery&rsquo;s information, if he be Drood, but as useful a
question as another if Drood be Datchery, and wishes to maintain
the conversation.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Datchery&rsquo;s Score</span></h3>
<p>Datchery keeps a tavern score of his discoveries behind a
door, in cryptic chalk strokes.&nbsp; He does this, says Mr.
Walters, because, being Helena, he would betray himself if he
wrote in a female hand.&nbsp; But nobody would <i>write</i>
secrets on a door!&nbsp; He adds &ldquo;a moderate stroke,&rdquo;
after meeting the hag, though, says Mr. Walters, &ldquo;Edwin
Drood would have learned nothing new whatever&rdquo; from the
hag.</p>
<p>But Edwin would have learned something quite new, and very
important&mdash;that the hag was hunting Jasper.&nbsp; Next day
Datchery sees the woman shake her fists at Jasper in church, and
hears from her that she knows Jasper &ldquo;better far than all
the reverend parsons put together know him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Datchery
then adds a long thick line to his chalked score, yet, says Mr.
Walters, Datchery has learned &ldquo;nothing new to Edwin Drood,
if alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an obvious error.&nbsp; It is absolutely new to Edwin
Drood that the opium hag is intimately acquainted with his uncle,
Jasper, and hates Jasper with a deadly hatred.&nbsp; All this is
not only new to Drood, if alive, but is rich in promise of
further revelations.&nbsp; Drood, on Christmas Eve, had learned
from the hag only that she took opium, and that she had come from
town to Cloisterham, and had &ldquo;hunted for a needle in a
bottle of hay.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the sum of his
information.&nbsp; Now he learns that the woman knows, tracks,
has found, and hates, his worthy uncle, Jasper.&nbsp; He may
well, therefore, add a heavy mark to his score.</p>
<p>We must also ask, How could Helena, fresh from Ceylon, know
&ldquo;the old tavern way of keeping scores?&nbsp; Illegible
except to the scorer.&nbsp; The scorer not committed, the scored
debited with what is against him,&rdquo; as Datchery
observes.&nbsp; An Eurasian girl of twenty, new to England, would
not argue thus with herself: she would probably know nothing of
English tavern scores.&nbsp; We do not hear that Helena ever
opened a book: we do know that education had been denied to
her.&nbsp; What acquaintance could she have with old English
tavern customs?</p>
<p>If Drood is Datchery, then Dickens used a form of a very old
and favourite <i>ficelle</i> of his: the watching of a villain by
an improbable and unsuspected person, in this case thought to be
dead.&nbsp; If Helena is Datchery, the &ldquo;assumption&rdquo;
or personation is in the highest degree improbable, her whole
bearing is quite out of her possibilities, and the personation is
very absurd.</p>
<p>Here the story ends.</p>
<h2>THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Forster&rsquo;s Evidence</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have some external evidence as
to Dickens&rsquo;s solution of his own problem, from Forster. <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; On August 6, 1869, some weeks
before he began to work at his tale, Dickens, in a letter, told
Forster, &ldquo;I have a very curious and new idea for my new
story.&nbsp; Not communicable (or the interest of the book would
be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Forster must have instantly asked that the
incommunicable secret should be communicated to <i>him</i>, for
he tells us that &ldquo;<i>immediately after</i> I
learnt&rdquo;&mdash;the secret.&nbsp; But did he learn it?&nbsp;
Dickens was ill, and his plot, whatever it may have been, would
be irritatingly criticized by Forster before it was fully thought
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fules and bairns should not see half-done
work,&rdquo; and Dickens may well have felt that Forster should
not see work not even begun, but merely simmering in the
author&rsquo;s own fancy.</p>
<p>Forster does not tell us that Dickens communicated the secret
in a letter.&nbsp; He quotes none: he says &ldquo;I was
told,&rdquo; orally, that is.&nbsp; When he writes, five years
later (1874), &ldquo;Landless was, <i>I think</i>, to have
perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the
murderer,&rdquo; he is clearly trusting, not to a letter of
Dickens&rsquo;s, but to a defective memory; and he knows
it.&nbsp; He says that a nephew was to be murdered by an
uncle.&nbsp; The criminal was to confess in the condemned
cell.&nbsp; He was to find out that his crime had been needless,
and to be convicted by means of the ring (Rosa&rsquo;s
mother&rsquo;s ring) remaining in the quicklime that had
destroyed the body of Edwin.</p>
<p>Nothing &ldquo;new&rdquo; in all this, as Forster must have
seen.&nbsp; &ldquo;The originality,&rdquo; he explains,
&ldquo;was to consist in the review of the murderer&rsquo;s
career by himself at the close, when its temptations were to be
dwelt upon as if, not he the culprit, but some other man, were
the tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all this is not &ldquo;hard to work,&rdquo; and is not
&ldquo;original.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Mr. Proctor remarks, Dickens had
used that trick twice already.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Madman&rsquo;s
Manuscript,&rdquo; <i>Pickwick</i>; &ldquo;Clock Case
Confession,&rdquo; in <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s
Clock</i>.)&nbsp; The quicklime trick is also very old
indeed.&nbsp; The disguise of a woman as a man is as ancient as
the art of fiction: yet Helena <i>may</i> be Datchery, though
nobody guessed it before Mr. Cuming Walters.&nbsp; She ought not
to be Datchery; she is quite out of keeping in her speech and
manner as Datchery, and is much more like Drood.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A New Idea</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>There are no new ideas in plots.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the stories
have been told,&rdquo; and all the merit lies in the manner of
the telling.&nbsp; Dickens had used the unsuspected watcher, as
Mr. Proctor shows, in almost all his novels.&nbsp; In <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, when Jonas finds that Nadgett has been the
watcher, Dickens writes, &ldquo;The dead man might have come out
of his grave and not confounded and appalled him so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, to Jasper, Edwin <i>was</i> &ldquo;the dead man,&rdquo; and
Edwin&rsquo;s grave contained quicklime.&nbsp; Jasper was sure
that he had done for Edwin: he had taken Edwin&rsquo;s watch,
chain, and scarf-pin; he believed that he had left him, drugged,
in quicklime, in a locked vault.&nbsp; Consequently the
reappearance of Edwin, quite well, in the vault where Jasper had
buried him, would be a very new idea to Jasper; would
&ldquo;confound and appall him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper would have
emotions, at that spectacle, and so would the reader!&nbsp; It is
not every day, even in our age of sixpenny novels, that a
murderer is compelled to visit, alone, at night, the vault which
holds his victim&rsquo;s &ldquo;cold remains,&rdquo; and therein
finds the victim &ldquo;come up, smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, for business purposes, this idea was new enough!&nbsp;
The idea was &ldquo;difficult to work,&rdquo; says Dickens, with
obvious truth.&nbsp; How was he to get the quicklime into the
vault, and Drood, alive, out of the vault?&nbsp; As to the
reader, he would at first take Datchery for Drood, and then
think, &ldquo;No, that is impossible, and also is stale.&nbsp;
Datchery cannot be Drood,&rdquo; and thus the reader would remain
in a pleasant state of puzzledom, as he does, unto this day.</p>
<p>If Edwin is dead, there is not much &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo;
about him.&nbsp; We have as good as seen Jasper strangle him and
take his pin, chain, and watch.&nbsp; Yet by adroitly managing
the conduct of Mr. Grewgious, Dickens persuaded Mr. Proctor that
certainly, Grewgious knew Edwin to be alive.&nbsp; As Grewgious
knew, from Helena, all that was necessary to provoke his
experiment on Jasper&rsquo;s nerves, Mr. Proctor argued on false
premises, but that was due to the craft of Dickens.&nbsp; Mr.
Proctor rejected Forster&rsquo;s report, from memory, of what he
understood to be the &ldquo;incommunicable secret&rdquo; of
Dickens&rsquo;s plot, and I think that he was justified in the
rejection.&nbsp; Forster does not seem to have cared about the
thing&mdash;he refers lightly to &ldquo;the reader curious in
such matters&rdquo;&mdash;when once he had received his
explanation from Dickens.&nbsp; His memory, in the space of five
years, may have been inaccurate: he probably neither knew nor
cared who Datchery was; and he may readily have misunderstood
what Dickens told him, orally, about the ring, as the instrument
of detection.&nbsp; Moreover, Forster quite overlooked one source
of evidence, as I shall show later.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s Theory</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s theory of the story is that Jasper, after
Edwin&rsquo;s return at midnight on Christmas Eve, recommended a
warm drink&mdash;mulled wine, drugged&mdash;and then proposed
another stroll of inspection of the effects of the storm.&nbsp;
He then strangled him, somewhere, and placed him in the quicklime
in the Sapsea vault, locked him in, and went to bed.&nbsp; Next,
according to Mr. Proctor, Durdles, then, &ldquo;lying drunk in
the precincts,&rdquo; for some reason taps with his hammer on the
wall of the Sapsea vault, detects the presence of a foreign body,
opens the tomb, and finds Drood in the quicklime, &ldquo;his face
fortunately protected by the strong silk shawl with which Jasper
has intended to throttle him.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">A Mistaken Theory</span></h3>
<p>This is &ldquo;thin,&rdquo; very &ldquo;thin!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dickens must have had some better scheme than Mr.
Proctor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Why did Jasper not &ldquo;mak
sikker&rdquo; like Kirkpatrick with the Red Comyn?&nbsp; Why did
he leave his silk scarf?&nbsp; It might come to be asked for; to
be sure the quicklime would destroy it, but why did Jasper leave
it?&nbsp; Why did the intoxicated Durdles come out of the crypt,
if he was there, enter the graveyard, and begin tapping at the
wall of the vault?&nbsp; Why not open the door? he had the
key.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, all this to have occurred, and suppose, with
Mr. Proctor, that Durdles and Deputy carried Edwin to the
Tramps&rsquo; lodgings, would Durdles fail to recognize
Edwin?&nbsp; We are to guess that Grewgious was present, or
disturbed at his inn, or somehow brought into touch with Edwin,
and bribed Durdles to silence, &ldquo;until a scheme for the
punishment of Jasper had been devised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this set of conjectures is crude to the last degree.&nbsp;
We do not know how Dickens meant to get Edwin into and out of the
vault.&nbsp; Granting that Edwin was drugged, Jasper might lead
Edwin in, considering the licence extended to the effects of
drugs in novels, and might strangle him there.&nbsp; Above all,
how did Grewgious, if in Cloisterham, come to be at hand at
midnight?</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Another Way</span></h3>
<p>If I must make a guess, I conjecture that Jasper had one of
his &ldquo;filmy&rdquo; seizures, was &ldquo;in a frightful sort
of dream,&rdquo; and bungled the murder: made an incomplete job
of it.&nbsp; Half-strangled men and women have often
recovered.&nbsp; In Jasper&rsquo;s opium vision and reminiscence
there was no resistance, all was very soon over.&nbsp; Jasper
might even bungle the locking of the door of the vault.&nbsp; He
was apt to have a seizure after opium, in moments of excitement,
and <i>he had been at the opium den through the night of
December</i> 23, for the hag tracked him from her house in town
to Cloisterham on December 24, the day of the crime.&nbsp; Grant
that his accustomed fit came upon him during the excitement of
the murder, as it does come after &ldquo;a nicht wi&rsquo;
opium,&rdquo; in chapter ii., when Edwin excites him by
contemptuous talk of the girl whom Jasper loves so
furiously&mdash;and then anything may happen!</p>
<p>Jasper murders Edwin inefficiently; he has a fit; while he is
unconscious the quicklime revives Edwin, by burning his hand,
say, and, during Jasper&rsquo;s swoon, Edwin, like another famous
prisoner, &ldquo;has a happy thought, he opens the door, and
walks out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being drugged, he is in a dreamy state; knows not clearly what
has occurred, or who attacked him.&nbsp; Jasper revives,
&ldquo;look on&rsquo;t again he dare not,&rdquo;&mdash;on the
body of his victim&mdash;and <i>he</i> walks out and goes home,
where his red lamp has burned all the time&mdash;&ldquo;thinking
it all wery capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another way,&rdquo;&mdash;Jasper not only fails to
strangle Drood, but fails to lock the door of the vault, and
Drood walks out after Jasper has gone.&nbsp; Jasper has, before
his fit, &ldquo;removed from the body the most lasting, the best
known, and most easily recognizable things upon it, the watch and
scarf-pin.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Dickens puts the popular view of the
case against Neville Landless, and so we are to presume that
Jasper acted.&nbsp; If he removed no more things from the body
than these, he made a fatal oversight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how does Edwin, once out of the vault, make good a
secret escape from Cloisterham?&nbsp; Mr. Proctor invokes the aid
of Mr. Grewgious, but does not explain why Grewgious was on the
spot.&nbsp; I venture to think it not inconceivable that Mr.
Grewgious having come down to Cloisterham by a late train, on
Christmas Eve, to keep his Christmas appointment with Rosa, paid
a darkling visit to the tomb of his lost love, Rosa&rsquo;s
mother.&nbsp; Grewgious was very sentimental, but too secretive
to pay such a visit by daylight.&nbsp; &ldquo;A night of memories
and sighs&rdquo; he might &ldquo;consecrate&rdquo; to his lost
lady love, as Landor did to Rose Aylmer.&nbsp; Grewgious was to
have helped Bazzard to eat a turkey on Christmas Day.&nbsp; But
he could get out of that engagement.&nbsp; He would wish to see
Edwin and Rosa together, and Edwin was leaving Cloisterham.&nbsp;
The date of Grewgious&rsquo;s arrival at Cloisterham is
studiously concealed.&nbsp; I offer at least a conceivable motive
for Grewgious&rsquo;s possible presence at the churchyard.&nbsp;
Mrs. Bud, his lost love, we have been told, was buried hard by
the Sapsea monument.&nbsp; If Grewgious visited her tomb, he was
on the spot to help Edwin, supposing Edwin to escape.&nbsp;
Unlikelier things occur in novels.&nbsp; I do not, in fact, call
these probable occurrences in every-day life, but none of the
story is probable.&nbsp; Jasper&rsquo;s &ldquo;weird
seizures&rdquo; are meant to lead up to <i>something</i>.&nbsp;
They may have been meant to lead up to the failure of the murder
and the escape of Edwin.&nbsp; Of course Dickens would not have
treated these incidents, when he came to make Edwin
explain,&mdash;nobody else could explain,&mdash;in my studiously
simple style.&nbsp; The drugged Edwin himself would remember the
circumstances but mistily: his evidence would be of no value
against Jasper.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor next supposes, we saw, that Drood got into touch
with Grewgious, and I have added the circumstances which might
take Grewgious to the churchyard.&nbsp; Next, when Edwin
recovered health, he came down, perhaps, as Datchery, to spy on
Jasper.&nbsp; I have elsewhere said, as Mr. Cuming Walters quotes
me, that &ldquo;fancy can suggest no reason why Edwin Drood, if
he escaped from his wicked uncle, should go spying about instead
of coming openly forward.&nbsp; No plausible unfantastic reason
could be invented.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later, I shall explain why Edwin,
if he is Datchery, might go spying alone.</p>
<p>It is also urged that Edwin left Rosa in sorrow, and left
blame on Neville Landless.&nbsp; Why do this?&nbsp; Mr. Proctor
replies that Grewgious&rsquo;s intense and watchful interest in
Neville, otherwise unexplained, is due to his knowledge that
Drood is alive, and that Neville must be cared for, while
Grewgious has told Rosa that Edwin lives.&nbsp; He also told her
of Edwin&rsquo;s real love of her, hence Miss Bud says,
&ldquo;Poor, poor Eddy,&rdquo; quite <i>&agrave; propos de
bottes</i>, when she finds herself many fathoms deep in love with
Lieutenant Tartar, R.N.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Poor, poor
Eddy!&rsquo; thought Rosa, as they walked along,&rdquo; Tartar
and she.&nbsp; This is a plausible suggestion of Mr.
Proctor.&nbsp; Edwin, though known to Rosa to be alive, has no
chance!&nbsp; But, as to my own remark, &ldquo;why should not
Edwin come forward at once, instead of spying about?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Well, if he did, there would be no story.&nbsp; As for &ldquo;an
unfantastic reason&rdquo; for his conduct, Dickens is not writing
an &ldquo;unfantastic&rdquo; novel.&nbsp; Moreover, if things
occurred as I have suggested, I do not see what evidence Drood
had against Jasper.&nbsp; Edwin&rsquo;s clothes were covered with
lime, but, when he told his story, Jasper would reply that Drood
never returned to his house on Christmas Eve, but stayed out,
&ldquo;doing what was correct by the season, in the way of giving
it the welcome it had the right to expect,&rdquo; like Durdles on
another occasion.&nbsp; Drood&rsquo;s evidence, if it was what I
have suggested, would sound like the dream of an intoxicated man,
and what other evidence could be adduced?&nbsp; Thus I had worked
out Drood&rsquo;s condition, if he really was not killed, in this
way: I had supposed him to escape, in a very mixed frame of mind,
when he would be encountered by Grewgious, who, of course, could
make little out of him in his befogged state.&nbsp; Drood could
not even prove that it was not Landless who attacked him.&nbsp;
The result would be that Drood would lie low, and later, would
have reason enough for disguising himself as Datchery, and
playing the spy in Cloisterham.</p>
<p>At this point I was reinforced by an opinion which Mr. William
Archer had expressed, unknown to me, in a newspaper
article.&nbsp; I had described Edwin&rsquo;s confused knowledge
of his own experience, if he were thoroughly drugged, and then
half strangled.&nbsp; Mr. Archer also took that point, and added
that Edwin being a good-hearted fellow, and fond of his uncle
Jasper, he would not bring, or let Grewgious bring, a terrible
charge against Jasper, till he knew more certainly the whole
state of the case.&nbsp; For that reason, he would come disguised
to Cloisterham and make inquiries.&nbsp; By letting Jasper know
about the ring, he would compel him to enter the vault, and then,
Mr. Archer thinks, would induce him to &ldquo;repent and begin
life afresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scarcely think that Datchery&rsquo;s purpose was so truly
honourable: he rather seems to be getting up a case against
Jasper.&nbsp; Still, the idea of Mr. Archer is very plausible,
and, at least, given Drood&rsquo;s need of evidence, and the lack
of evidence against Jasper, we see reason good, in a novel of
this kind, for his playing the part of amateur detective.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dickens&rsquo;s Unused Draft of a
Chapter</span></h3>
<p>Forster found, and published, a very illegible sketch of a
chapter of the tale: &ldquo;How Mr. Sapsea ceased to be a Member
of the Eight Club, Told by Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
&ldquo;a cramped, interlined, and blotted&rdquo; draft, on paper
of only half the size commonly used by Dickens.&nbsp; Mr. Sapsea
tells how his Club mocked him about a stranger, who had mistaken
him for the Dean.&nbsp; The jackass, Sapsea, left the Club, and
met the stranger, <i>a young man</i>, who fooled him to the top
of his bent, saying, &ldquo;If I was to deny that I came to this
town to see and hear you, Sir, what would it avail
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently this paper was a rough draft of an
idea for introducing a detective, as a <i>young</i> man, who
mocks Sapsea just as Datchery does in the novel.&nbsp; But to
make the spy a <i>young</i> man, whether the spy was Drood or
Helena Landless, was too difficult; and therefore Dickens makes
Datchery &ldquo;an elderly buffer&rdquo; in a white wig.&nbsp; If
I am right, it was easier for Helena, a girl, to pose as a young
man, than for Drood to reappear as a young man, not
himself.&nbsp; Helena <i>may</i> be Datchery, and yet Drood may
be alive and biding his time; but I have disproved my old
objection that there was no reason why Drood, if alive, should go
spying about in disguise.&nbsp; There were good Dickensian
reasons.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">A Question of Taste</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters argues that the story is very tame if Edwin
is still alive, and left out of the marriages at the close.&nbsp;
Besides, &ldquo;Drood is little more than a name-label, attached
to a body, a man who never excites sympathy, whose fate causes no
emotion, he is saved for no useful or sentimental purpose, and
lags superfluous on the stage.&nbsp; All of which is bad art, so
bad that Dickens would never have been guilty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is a question of taste.&nbsp; On rereading the novel, I
see that Dickens makes Drood as sympathetic as he can.&nbsp; He
is very young, and speaks of Rosa with bad taste, but he is
really in love with her, much more so than she with him, and he
is piqued by her ceaseless mockery, and by their false
position.&nbsp; To Jasper he is singularly tender, and remorseful
when he thinks that he has shown want of tact.&nbsp; There is
nothing ominous about his gaiety: as to his one fault, we leave
him, on Christmas Eve, a converted character: he has a kind word
and look for every one whom he meets, young and old.&nbsp; He
accepts Mr. Grewgious&rsquo;s very stern lecture in the best
manner possible.&nbsp; In short, he is marked as
faulty&mdash;&ldquo;I am young,&rdquo; so he excuses himself, in
the very words of Darnley to Queen Mary! (if the Glasgow letter
be genuine); but he is also marked as sympathetic.</p>
<p>He was, I think, to have a lesson, and to become a good
fellow.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor rightly argues (and Forster
&ldquo;thinks&rdquo;), that Dickens meant to kill Neville
Landless: Mr. Cuming Walters agrees with him, but Mr. Proctor
truly adds that Edwin has none of the signs of Dickens&rsquo;s
doomed men, his Sidney Cartons, and the rest.&nbsp; You can tell,
as it were by the sound of the voice of Dickens, says Mr.
Proctor, that Edwin is to live.&nbsp; The impression is merely
subjective, but I feel the impression.&nbsp; The doom of Landless
is conspicuously fixed, and why is Landless to be killed by
Jasper?&nbsp; Merely to have a count on which to hang
Jasper!&nbsp; He cannot be hanged for killing Drood, if Drood is
alive.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s Theory
Continued</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Proctor next supposes that Datchery and others, by aid of
the opium hag, have found out a great deal of evidence against
Jasper.&nbsp; They have discovered from the old woman that his
crime was long premeditated: he had threatened &ldquo;Ned&rdquo;
in his opiated dreams: and had clearly removed Edwin&rsquo;s
trinkets and watch, because they would not be destroyed, with his
body, by the quicklime.&nbsp; This is all very well, but there is
still, so far, no legal evidence, on my theory, that Jasper
attempted to take Edwin&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Jasper&rsquo;s
enemies, therefore, can only do their best to make his life a
burden to him, and to give him a good fright, probably with the
hope of terrifying him into avowals.</p>
<p>Now the famous ring begins &ldquo;to drag and hold&rdquo; the
murderer.&nbsp; He is given to know, I presume, that, when Edwin
disappeared, he had a gold ring in the pocket of his coat.&nbsp;
Jasper is thus compelled to revisit the vault, at night, and
there, in the light of his lantern, he sees the long-lost Edwin,
with his hand in the breast of his great coat.</p>
<p>Horrified by this unexpected appearance, Jasper turns to
fly.&nbsp; But he is confronted by Neville Landless, Crisparkle,
Tartar, and perhaps by Mr. Grewgious, who are all on the
watch.&nbsp; He rushes up through the only outlet, the winding
staircase of the Cathedral tower, of which we know that he has
had the key.&nbsp; Neville, who leads his pursuers,
&ldquo;receives his death wound&rdquo; (and, I think, is pitched
off the top of the roof).&nbsp; Then Jasper is collared by that
agile climber, Tartar, and by Crisparkle, always in the pink of
condition.&nbsp; There is now something to hang Jasper
for&mdash;the slaying of Landless (though, as far as I can see,
<i>that</i> was done in self-defence).&nbsp; Jasper confesses
all; Tartar marries Rosa; Helena marries Crisparkle.&nbsp; Edwin
is only twenty-one, and may easily find a consoler of the fair
sex: indeed he is &ldquo;ower young to marry yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capture of Jasper was fixed, of course, for Christmas
Eve.&nbsp; The phantom cry foreheard by Durdles, two years
before, was that of Neville as he fell; and the dog that howled
was Neville&rsquo;s dog, a character not yet introduced into the
romance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Cuming Walters&rsquo;s
Theory</span></h3>
<p>Such is Mr. Proctor&rsquo;s theory of the story, in which I
mainly agree.&nbsp; Mr. Proctor relies on a piece of evidence
overlooked by Forster, and certainly misinterpreted, as I think I
can prove to a certainty, by Mr. Cuming Walters, whose theory of
the real conduct of the plot runs thus: After watching the storm
at midnight with Edwin, Neville left him, and went home:
&ldquo;his way lay in an opposite direction.&nbsp; Near to the
Cathedral Jasper intercepted his nephew. . . . Edwin may have
been already drugged.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the murder was worked Mr.
Cuming Walters does not say, but he introduces at this point, the
two sounds foreheard by Durdles, without explaining &ldquo;the
howl of a dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; Durdles would hear the cries, and
Deputy &ldquo;had seen what he could not understand,&rdquo;
whatever it was that he saw.&nbsp; Jasper, not aware of
Drood&rsquo;s possession of the ring, takes only his watch,
chain, and pin, which he places on the timbers of the weir, and
in the river, to be picked up by that persistent winter-bather,
Crisparkle of the telescopic and microscopic eyesight.</p>
<p>As to the ring, Mr. Cuming Walters erroneously declares that
Mr. Proctor &ldquo;ignores&rdquo; the power of the ring &ldquo;to
hold and drag,&rdquo; and says that potent passage is
&ldquo;without meaning and must be disregarded.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Proctor, in fact, gives more than three pages to the meaning of
the ring, which &ldquo;drags&rdquo; Jasper into the vault, when
he hears of its existence. <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; Next, Mr.
Cuming Walters supposes Datchery to learn from Durdles, whom he
is to visit, about the second hearing of the cry and the
dog&rsquo;s howl.&nbsp; Deputy may have seen Jasper
&ldquo;carrying his burden&rdquo; (Edwin) &ldquo;towards the
Sapsea vault.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, Jasper probably saved trouble
by making the drugged Edwin walk into that receptacle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Datchery would not think of the Sapsea vault
unaided.&rdquo;&nbsp; No&mdash;unless Datchery was Drood!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now Durdles is useful again.&nbsp; Tapping with his hammer
he would find a change . . . inquiry must be made.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Why should Durdles tap the Sapsea monument?&nbsp; As Durdles had
the key, he would simply walk into the vault, and find the
quicklime.&nbsp; Now, Jasper also, we presume, had a key, made
from a wax impression of the original.&nbsp; If he had any sense,
he would have removed the quicklime as easily as he inserted it,
for Mr. Sapsea was mortal: he might die any day, and be buried,
and then the quicklime, lying where it ought not, would give rise
to awkward inquiries.</p>
<p>Inquiry being made, in consequence of Durdles&rsquo;s
tappings, the ring would be found, as Mr. Cuming Walters
says.&nbsp; But even then, unless Deputy actually saw Jasper
carry a man into the vault, nobody could prove Jasper&rsquo;s
connection with the presence of the ring in the vault.&nbsp;
Moreover, Deputy hated Jasper, and if he saw Jasper carrying the
body of a man, on the night when a man disappeared, he was clever
enough to lead Durdles to examine the vault, <i>at
once</i>.&nbsp; Deputy had a great dislike of the Law and its
officers, but here was a chance for him to distinguish himself,
and conciliate them.</p>
<p>However these things may be, Mr. Cuming Walters supposes that
Jasper, finding himself watched, re-enters the vault, perhaps,
&ldquo;to see that every trace of the crime had been
removed.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the vault he finds&mdash;Datchery, that
is, Helena Landless!&nbsp; Jasper certainly visited the vault and
found somebody.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Evidence of Collins&rsquo;s
Drawings</span></h3>
<p>We now come to the evidence which Forster strangely
overlooked, which Mr. Proctor and Mr. Archer correctly
deciphered, and which Mr. Cuming Walters misinterprets.&nbsp; On
December 22, 1869, Dickens wrote to Forster that two numbers of
his romance were &ldquo;now in type.&nbsp; Charles Collins has
designed an excellent cover.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. C. A. Collins had
married a daughter of Dickens. <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; He was an
artist, a great friend of Dickens, and author of that charming
book, &ldquo;A Cruise on Wheels.&rdquo;&nbsp; His design of the
paper cover of the story (it appeared in monthly numbers)
contained, as usual, sketches which give an inkling of the events
in the tale.&nbsp; Mr. Collins was to have illustrated the book;
but, finally, Mr. (now Sir) Luke Fildes undertook the task.&nbsp;
Mr. Collins died in 1873.&nbsp; It appears that Forster never
asked him the meaning of his designs&mdash;a singular
oversight.</p>
<p>The cover lies before the reader.&nbsp; In the left-hand top
corner appears an allegorical female figure of joy, with
flowers.&nbsp; The central top space contains the front of
Cloisterham Cathedral, or rather, the nave.&nbsp; To the left
walks Edwin, with hyacinthine locks, and a thoroughly classical
type of face, and Grecian nose.&nbsp; <i>Like Datchery</i>, <i>he
does not wear</i>, <i>but carries his hat</i>; this means
nothing, if they are in the nave.&nbsp; He seems bored.&nbsp; On
his arm is Rosa; <i>she</i> seems bored; she trails her parasol,
and looks away from Edwin, looks down, to her right.&nbsp; On the
spectator&rsquo;s right march the surpliced men and boys of the
Choir.&nbsp; Behind them is Jasper, black whiskers and all; he
stares after Edwin and Rosa; his right hand hides his
mouth.&nbsp; In the corner above him is an allegorical female,
clasping a stiletto.</p>
<p>Beneath Edwin and Rosa is, first, an allegorical female
figure, looking at a placard, headed &ldquo;LOST,&rdquo; on a
door.&nbsp; Under that, again, is a girl in a garden-chair; a
young man, whiskerless, with wavy hair, kneels and kisses her
hand.&nbsp; She looks rather unimpassioned.&nbsp; I conceive the
man to be Landless, taking leave of Rosa after urging his
hopeless suit, for which Helena, we learn, &ldquo;seems to
compassionate him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has avowed his passion, early
in the story, to Crisparkle.&nbsp; Below, the opium hag is
smoking.&nbsp; On the other side, under the figures of Jasper and
the Choir, the young man who kneels to the girl is seen bounding
up a spiral staircase.&nbsp; His left hand is on the iron
railing; he stoops over it, looking down at others who follow
him.&nbsp; His right hand, the index finger protruded, points
upward, and, by chance or design, points straight at Jasper in
the vignette above.&nbsp; Beneath this man (clearly Landless)
follows a tall man in a &ldquo;bowler&rdquo; hat, a
&ldquo;cut-away&rdquo; coat, and trousers which show an inch of
white stocking above the low shoes.&nbsp; His profile is hid by
the wall of the spiral staircase: he might be Grewgious of the
shoes, white stockings, and short trousers, but he may be Tartar:
he takes two steps at a stride.&nbsp; Beneath him a youngish man,
in a low, soft, clerical hat and a black pea-coat, ascends,
looking downwards and backwards.&nbsp; This is clearly
Crisparkle.&nbsp; A Chinaman is smoking opium beneath.</p>
<p>In the central lowest space, a dark and whiskered man enters a
dark chamber; his left hand is on the lock of the door; in his
right he holds up a lantern.&nbsp; The light of the lantern
reveals a young man in a soft hat of Tyrolese shape.&nbsp; His
features are purely classical, his nose is Grecian, his locks are
long (at least, according to the taste of to-day); he wears a
light paletot, buttoned to the throat; his right arm hangs by his
side; his left hand is thrust into the breast of his coat.&nbsp;
He calmly regards the dark man with the lantern.&nbsp; That man,
of course, is Jasper.&nbsp; The young man is EDWIN DROOD, of the
Grecian nose, hyacinthine locks, and classic features, as in Sir
L. Fildes&rsquo;s third illustration.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor correctly understood the unmistakable meaning of
this last design, Jasper entering the vault&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>To-day the dead are living</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The lost is found to-day</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters tells us that he did not examine these
designs by Mr. Collins till he had formed his theory, and
finished his book.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the conclusion of the whole
work the pictures were referred to for the first time, and were
then found to support in the most striking manner the opinions
arrived at,&rdquo; namely, that Drood was killed, and that Helena
is Datchery.&nbsp; Thus does theory blind us to facts!</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters connects the figure of the whiskerless
young man kneeling to a girl in a garden seat, with the whiskered
Jasper&rsquo;s proposal to Rosa in a garden seat.&nbsp; But
Jasper does not kneel to Rosa; he stands apart, leaning on a
sundial; he only once vaguely &ldquo;touches&rdquo; her, which
she resents; he does not kneel; he does not kiss her hand (Rosa
&ldquo;took the kiss sedately,&rdquo; like Maud in the poem);
and&mdash;Jasper had lustrous thick black whiskers.</p>
<p>Again, the same whiskerless young man, bounding up the spiral
staircase in daylight, and wildly pointing upwards, is taken by
Mr. Cuming Walters to represent Jasper climbing the staircase to
reconnoitre, at night, with a lantern, and, of course, with black
whiskers.&nbsp; The two well-dressed men on the stairs
(Grewgious, or Tartar, and Crisparkle) also, according to Mr.
Cuming Walters, &ldquo;relate to Jasper&rsquo;s unaccountable
expedition with Durdles to the Cathedral.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither of
them is Jasper; neither of them is Durdles, &ldquo;in a suit of
coarse flannel&rdquo;&mdash;a disreputable jacket, as Sir L.
Fildes depicts him&mdash;&ldquo;with horn buttons,&rdquo; and a
battered old tall hat.&nbsp; These interpretations are quite
demonstrably erroneous and even impossible.&nbsp; Mr. Archer
interprets the designs exactly as I do.</p>
<p>As to the young man in the light of Jasper&rsquo;s lamp, Mr.
Cuming Walters says, &ldquo;the large hat and the
tightly-buttoned surtout must be observed; they are the articles
of clothing on which most stress is laid in the description of
Datchery.&nbsp; But the face is young.&rdquo;&nbsp; The face of
Datchery was elderly, and he had a huge shock of white hair, a
wig.&nbsp; Datchery wore &ldquo;a tightish blue surtout, with a
buff waistcoat and grey trousers; he had something of a military
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man in the vault has anything but a
military air; he shows no waistcoat, and he does not wear
&ldquo;a tightish blue surtout,&rdquo; or any surtout at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The surtout of the period is shown, worn by Jasper, in Sir L.
Fildes&rsquo;s sixth and ninth illustrations.&nbsp; It is a
frock-coat; the collar descends far below the top of the
waistcoat (buff or otherwise), displaying that garment; the coat
is tightly buttoned beneath, revealing the figure; the tails of
the coat do not reach the knees of the wearer.&nbsp; The young
man in the vault, on the other hand, wears a loose paletot,
buttoned to the throat (vaults are chilly places), and the coat
falls so as to cover the knees; at least, partially.&nbsp; The
young man is not, like Helena, &ldquo;very dark, and fierce of
look, . . . of almost the gipsy type.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is blonde,
sedate, and of the classic type, as Drood was.&nbsp; He is no
more like Helena than Crisparkle is like Durdles.&nbsp; Mr.
Cuming Walters says that Mr. Proctor was &ldquo;unable to allude
to the prophetic picture by Collins.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a fact, this
picture is fully described by Mr. Proctor, but Mr. Walters used
the wrong edition of his book, unwittingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Creeping down the crypt
steps, oppressed by growing horror and by terror of coming
judgment, sickening under fears engendered by the darkness of
night and the charnel-house air he breathed, Jasper opens the
door of the tomb and holds up his lantern, shuddering at the
thought of what it may reveal to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what sees he?&nbsp; Is it the spirit of his victim
that stands there, &lsquo;in his habit as he lived,&rsquo; his
hand clasped on his breast, where the ring had been when he was
murdered?&nbsp; What else can Jasper deem it?&nbsp; There,
clearly visible in the gloom at the back of the tomb, stands
Edwin Drood, with stern look fixed on him&mdash;pale, silent,
relentless!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p86b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;On the title-page are given two of the small
pictures from the Love side of the cover, two from the Murder
side, and the central picture below, which presents the central
horror of the story&mdash;the end and aim of the &lsquo;Datchery
assumption&rsquo; and of Mr. Grewgious&rsquo;s
plans&mdash;showing Jasper driven to seek for the proofs of his
crime amid the dust to which, as he thought, the flesh and bones,
and the very clothes of his victim, had been reduced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are only two possible choices; either Collins, under
Dickens&rsquo;s oral instructions, depicted Jasper finding Drood
alive in the vault, an incident which was to occur in the story;
or Dickens bade Collins do this for the purpose of misleading his
readers in an illegitimate manner; while the young man in the
vault was really to be some person &ldquo;made up&rdquo; to look
like Drood, and so to frighten Jasper with a pseudo-ghost of that
hero.&nbsp; The latter device, the misleading picture, would be
childish, and the pseudo-ghost, exactly like Drood, could not be
acted by the gipsy-like, fierce Helena, or by any other person in
the romance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters&rsquo;s Theory
Continued</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters guesses that Jasper was to aim a deadly
blow (with his left hand, to judge from the picture) at Helena,
and that Neville &ldquo;was to give his life for
hers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, manifestly, Neville was to lead the hunt
of Jasper up the spiral stair, as in Collins&rsquo;s design, and
was to be dashed from the roof: his body beneath was to be
&ldquo;<i>that</i>, I never saw before.&nbsp; <i>That</i> must be
real.&nbsp; Look what a poor mean miserable thing it is!&rdquo;
as Jasper says in his vision.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters, pursuing his idea of Helena as both
Datchery and also as the owner of &ldquo;the <i>young</i>
face&rdquo; of the youth in the vault (and also of the young
hands, a young girl&rsquo;s hands could never pass for those of
&ldquo;an elderly buffer&rdquo;), exclaims: &ldquo;Imagine the
intense power of the dramatic climax, when Datchery, the elderly
man, is re-transformed into Helena Landless, the young and
handsome woman; and when she reveals the seemingly impenetrable
secret which had been closed up in one guilty man&rsquo;s
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The situations are startling, I admit, but how would Canon
Crisparkle like them?&nbsp; He is, we know, to marry Helena,
&ldquo;the young person, my dear,&rdquo; Miss Twinkleton would
say, &ldquo;who for months lived alone, at inns, wearing a blue
surtout, a buff waistcoat, and grey&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
horror chokes the utterance of Miss Twinkleton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
she was in the vault in <i>another</i> disguise, not more
womanly, at that awful scene when poor Mr. Jasper was driven mad,
so that he confessed all sorts of nonsense, for, my dear, all the
Close believes that it <i>was</i> nonsense, and that Mr. Jasper
was reduced to insanity by persecution.&nbsp; And Mr. Crisparkle,
with that elegant dainty mother of his&mdash;it has broken her
heart&mdash;is marrying this half-caste gipsy <i>trollop</i>,
with her blue surtout and grey&mdash;oh, it is a disgrace to
Cloisterham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The climax, in fact, as devised by Mr. Cuming Walters, is
rather too dramatic for the comfort of a minor canon.&nbsp; A
humorist like Dickens ought to have seen the absurdity of the
situation.&nbsp; Mr. Walters <i>may</i> be right, Helena may be
Datchery, but she ought not to be.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Who was the Princess Puffer</span>?</h3>
<p>Who was the opium hag, the Princess Puffer?&nbsp; Mr. Cuming
Walters writes: &ldquo;We make a guess, for Dickens gives us no
solid facts.&nbsp; But when we remember that not a word is said
throughout the volume of Jasper&rsquo;s antecedents, who he was,
and where he came from; when we remember that but for his nephew
he was a lonely man; when we see that he was both criminal and
artist; when we observe his own wheedling propensity, his false
and fulsome protestations of affection, his slyness, his
subtlety, his heartlessness, his tenacity; and when, above all,
we know that the opium vice is <i>hereditary</i>, and that a
<i>young</i> man would not be addicted to it unless born with the
craving; <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a> then, it is not too wild a conjecture
that Jasper was the wayward progeny of this same opium-eating
woman, all of whose characteristics he possessed, and, perchance,
of a man of criminal instincts, but of a superior position.&nbsp;
Jasper is a morbid and diseased being while still in the
twenties, a mixture of genius and vice.&nbsp; He hates and he
loves fiercely, as if there were wild gipsy blood in his
veins.&nbsp; Though seemingly a model of decorum and devoted to
his art, he complains of his &ldquo;daily drudging round&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the cramped monotony of his existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
commits his crime with the ruthlessness of a beast, his own
nature being wholly untamed.&nbsp; If we deduce that his father
was an adventurer and a vagabond, we shall not be far
wrong.&nbsp; If we deduce that his mother was the opium-eater,
prematurely aged, who had transmitted her vicious propensity to
her child, we shall almost certainly be right.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Who was Jasper</span>?</h3>
<p>Who was Jasper?&nbsp; He was the brother-in-law of the late
Mr. Drood, a respected engineer, and University man.&nbsp; We do
not know whence came Mrs. Drood, Jasper&rsquo;s sister, but is it
likely that her mother &ldquo;drank
heaven&rsquo;s-hard&rdquo;&mdash;so the hag says of
herself&mdash;then took to keeping an opium den, and there
entertained her son Jasper, already an accomplished vocalist, but
in a lower station than that to which his musical genius later
raised him, as lay Precentor?&nbsp; If the Princess Puffer be, as
on Mr. Cuming Walters&rsquo;s theory she is, Edwin&rsquo;s
long-lost grandmother, her discovery would be unwelcome to
Edwin.&nbsp; Probably she did not live much longer; &ldquo;my
lungs are like cabbage nets,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; Mr. Cuming
Walters goes on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her purpose is left obscure.&nbsp; How easily, however,
we see possibilities in a direction such as this.&nbsp; The
father, perhaps a proud, handsome man, deserts the woman, and
removes the child.&nbsp; The woman hates both for scorning her,
but the father dies, or disappears, and is beyond her
vengeance.&nbsp; Then the child, victim to the ills in his blood,
creeps back to the opium den, not knowing his mother, but
immediately recognized by her.&nbsp; She will make the child
suffer for the sins of the father, who had destroyed her
happiness.&nbsp; Such a theme was one which appealed to
Dickens.&nbsp; It must not, however, be urged; and the crucial
question after all is concerned with the opium woman as one of
the unconscious instruments of justice, aiding with her trifle of
circumstantial evidence the Nemesis awaiting Jasper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another hypothesis&mdash;following on the Carker theme
in &lsquo;Dombey and Son&rsquo;&mdash;is that Jasper, a dissolute
and degenerate man, lascivious, and heartless, may have wronged a
child of the woman&rsquo;s; but it is not likely that Dickens
would repeat the Mrs. Brown story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper, <i>p&egrave;re</i>, father of John Jasper and of Mrs.
Drood, however handsome, ought not to have deserted Mrs.
Jasper.&nbsp; Whether John Jasper, prematurely devoted to opium,
became Edwin&rsquo;s guardian at about the age of fifteen, or
whether, on attaining his majority, he succeeded to some other
guardian, is not very obvious.&nbsp; In short, we cannot guess
why the Princess Puffer hated Jasper, a paying client of long
standing.&nbsp; We are only certain that Jasper was a bad fellow,
and that the Princess Puffer said, &ldquo;I know him, better than
all the Reverend Parsons put together know him.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the other hand, Edwin &ldquo;seems to know&rdquo; the opium
woman, when he meets her on Christmas Eve, which may be a point
in favour of her being his long-lost grandmother.</p>
<p>Jasper was certainly tried and condemned; for Dickens intended
&ldquo;to take Mr. Fildes to a condemned cell in Maidstone, or
some other gaol, in order to make a drawing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; Possibly Jasper managed to take
his own life, in the cell; possibly he was duly hanged.</p>
<p>Jasper, after all, was a failure as a murderer, even if we
suppose him to have strangled his nephew successfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is obvious to the most excruciatingly feeble
capacity&rdquo; that, if he meant to get rid of proofs of the
identity of Drood&rsquo;s body by means of quicklime, it did not
suffice to remove Drood&rsquo;s pin, watch, and chain.&nbsp;
Drood would have coins of the realm in his pockets, gold, silver,
bronze.&nbsp; Quicklime would not destroy these metallic objects,
nor would it destroy keys, which would easily prove Drood&rsquo;s
identity.&nbsp; If Jasper knew his business, he would, of course,
rifle <i>all</i> of Edwin&rsquo;s pockets minutely, and would
remove the metallic buttons of his braces, which generally
display the maker&rsquo;s name, or the tailor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; On
research I find &ldquo;H. Poole &amp; Co., Savile Row&rdquo; on
my buttons.&nbsp; In this inquiry of his, Jasper would have
discovered the ring in Edwin&rsquo;s breast pocket, and would
have taken it away.&nbsp; Perhaps Dickens never thought of that
little fact: if he did think of it, no doubt he found some mode
of accounting for Jasper&rsquo;s unworkmanlike negligence.&nbsp;
The trouser-buttons would have led any inquirer straight to
Edwin&rsquo;s tailor; I incline to suspect that neither Dickens
nor Jasper noticed that circumstance.&nbsp; The conscientious
artist in crime cannot afford to neglect the humblest and most
obvious details.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to my theory, which
mainly rests on the unmistakable evidence of the cover drawn by
Collins under Dickens&rsquo;s directions, all &ldquo;ends
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper comes to the grief he deserves: Helena,
after her period of mourning for Neville, marries Crisparkle:
Rosa weds her mariner.&nbsp; Edwin, at twenty-one, is not
heart-broken, but, a greatly improved character, takes, to quote
his own words, &ldquo;a sensible interest in works of engineering
skill, especially when they are to change the whole condition of
an undeveloped country&rdquo;&mdash;Egypt.</p>
<p>These conclusions are inevitable unless we either suppose
Dickens to have arranged a disappointment for his readers in the
<i>tableau</i> of Jasper and Drood, in the vault, on the cover,
or can persuade ourselves that not Drood, but some other young
man, is revealed by the light of Jasper&rsquo;s lantern.&nbsp;
Now, the young man is very like Drood, and very unlike the dark
fierce Helena Landless: disguised as Drood, this time, not as
Datchery.&nbsp; All the difficulty as to why Drood, if he escaped
alive, did not at once openly denounce Jasper, is removed when we
remember, as Mr. Archer and I have independently pointed out,
that Drood, when attacked by Jasper, was (like Durdles in the
&ldquo;unaccountable expedition&rdquo;) stupefied by drugs, and
so had no valid evidence against his uncle.&nbsp; Whether science
is acquainted with the drugs necessary for such purposes is
another question.&nbsp; They are always kept in stock by starving
and venal apothecaries in fiction and the drama, and are a
recognized convention of romance.</p>
<p>So ends our unfolding of the Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
